Hi, I'm Iqma.

On this blog I publish detailed cybersecurity write-ups on CTFs, Crackmes, and many other things. Check it out here - https://iqmaa.github.io/

## Some Backstory
*for those who care*

One of the problems I faced when I first started with CTFs was the obscurity of writeups. I spend hours and sometimes days trying to solve a CTF without any breakthrough and open up a write-up as a last resort, which turns out to be vague and leaves me with even more unanswered questions.

Most CTF write-ups are just step by step walkthroughs showing what was done to get the flag with no reference to the thinking process behind the actions or even links for further explanation on why those steps were necessary. As someone completely new to cybersecurity, it might be a little confusing and you probably don't want to just solve the CTF but understand every single step taken towards solving it and why.

This blog is an attempt to fix that.
